/**
 * Chapter 3 - Question 3
 *
 * Stack of Plates: Imagine a (literal) stack of plates. If the stack gets
 * too high, it might topple. Therefore, in real life, we would likely start
 * a new stack when the previous stack exceeds some threshold. Implement a
 * data structure SetOfStacks that mimics this. SetOfStacks should be composed
 * of several stacks and should create a new stack once the previous one exceeds
 * capacity. SetOfStacks.push() and SetOfStacks.pop() should behave identically
 * to a single stack (that is, pop() should return the same values as it would
 * if there were just a single stack).
